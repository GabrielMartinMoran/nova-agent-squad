   - Clear description
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment details (OpenCode version, OS, model used)

2. Provide a clear use case

## Agent Modification Guidelines

When modifying agent prompts:

1. **Test locally first** - Copy agents to your OpenCode config and verify behavior
2. **Maintain anti-hallucination guards** - Never remove authorization gates
3. **Keep XML contracts** - Preserve the structured output tags
4. **Document changes** - Update CHANGELOG.md with clear descriptions
5. **Version appropriately** - Follow the versioning scheme in AGENTS.md
